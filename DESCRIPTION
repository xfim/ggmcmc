Package: ggmcmc
Title: Graphical tools for analyzing Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations from
    Bayesian inference.
Description: ggmcmc is a tool for assessing and diagnosing convergence of
    Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, as well as for graphically display
    results from full MCMC analysis. The package also facilitates the graphical
    interpretation of models by providing flexible functions to plot the
    results against observed variables.
